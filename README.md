# Temperature-Indicator-project-by-Balls

This is a temperaure indicator project, of which the basic idea is
that with the change of temperature the ball color will keep changing at the same rate 
as per the change of temperature. Hence, this application can be used at places where there is
regular change of the  temperature to be kept recorded. But seeing the ball color change instead
of the numbers as temperature will be a lot easier for the the person monitoring and will be more
efficient than the previous idea.

But anyway as here there is no thermometer, we haven't implemented the code or a library to connect
to thermometer. And that makes our idea incomplete, a motivation to get it completed in future.
